Did you forget your Instagram password but you don’t have access to your email or phone number?
If you don’t have access to your email or phone number, you won’t be able to reset your Instagram password.
Hence, you need to contact Instagram support for assistance in recovering your account.
Similarly, you need to do this if you think that your account is hacked.
However, contacting Instagram support is challenging because they are hard to reach out to.
The process of recovering your account is challenging as well because you need to verify your identity.
The verification process requires you to take a photo of yourself holding a code.
